When translating a framework without polymorphism (e.g. json-schema, solr document schema) then is a and mixins are recursively unfolded in_subset: - SpecificationSubset - BasicSubset - ObjectOrientedProfile - OwlProfile from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/meta rank: 11 abstract: true alias: is_a owner: anonymous_class_expression domain_of: - definition - anonymous_class_expression - permissible_value range: definition any_of: name: any_of description: holds if at least one of the expressions hold in_subset: - SpecificationSubset from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/meta see_also: - https://w3id.org/linkml/docs/specification/05validation/#rules exact_mappings: - sh:or rank: 101 is_a: boolean_slot alias: any_of owner: anonymous_class_expression domain_of: - type_expression - path_expression - slot_expression - class_expression range: anonymous_class_expression multivalued: true exactly_one_of: name: exactly_one_of description: holds if only one of the expressions hold in_subset: - SpecificationSubset from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/meta see_also: - https://w3id.org/linkml/docs/specification/05validation/#rules exact_mappings: - sh:xone rank: 103 is_a: boolean_slot alias: exactly_one_of owner: anonymous_class_expression domain_of: - type_expression - path_expression - slot_expression - class_expression range: anonymous_class_expression multivalued: true none_of: name: none_of description: holds if none of the expressions hold in_subset: - SpecificationSubset from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/meta see_also: - https://w3id.org/linkml/docs/specification/05validation/#rules exact_mappings: - sh:not rank: 105 is_a: boolean_slot alias: none_of owner: anonymous_class_expression domain_of: - type_expression - path_expression - slot_expression - class_expression range: anonymous_class_expression multivalued: true all_of: name: all_of description: holds if all of the expressions hold in_subset: - SpecificationSubset from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/meta see_also: - https://w3id.org/linkml/docs/specification/05validation/#rules exact_mappings: - sh:and rank: 107 is_a: boolean_slot alias: all_of owner: anonymous_class_expression domain_of: - type_expression - path_expression - slot_expression - class_expression range: anonymous_class_expression multivalued: true slot_conditions: name: slot_conditions description: expresses constraints on a group of slots for a class expression in_subset: - SpecificationSubset from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/meta rank: 1000 domain: class_expression alias: slot_conditions owner: anonymous_class_expression domain_of: - class_expression range: slot_definition multivalued: true inlined: true extensions: name: extensions description: a tag/text tuple attached to an arbitrary element from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/meta rank: 1000 domain: extensible alias: extensions owner: anonymous_class_expression domain_of: - extension - extensible range: extension multivalued: true inlined: true annotations: name: annotations description: a collection of tag/text tuples with the semantics of OWL Annotation from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/meta rank: 1000 is_a: extensions domain: annotatable alias: annotations owner: anonymous_class_expression domain_of: - annotatable - annotation range: annotation multivalued: true inlined: true description: name: description description: a textual description of the element's purpose and use in_subset: - BasicSubset from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/meta aliases: - definition exact_mappings: - dcterms:description - schema:description rank: 5 domain: element slot_uri: skos:definition alias: description owner: anonymous_class_expression domain_of: - common_metadata - permissible_value range: string recommended: true alt_descriptions: name: alt_descriptions description: A sourced alternative description for an element in_subset: - BasicSubset from_schema: https://w3id.org/linkml/meta aliases: - alternate definitions rank: 1000 domain: element alias: alt_descriptions owner: anonymous_class_expression domain_of: - common_metadata range: alt_description multivalued: true inlined: true title: name: title description: A concise human-readable display label for the element.

If both s-slots and v-slots are populated on an object then the value of the s-slot should correspond to the expansion. Implementations of frameworks may choose to use this property to either (a) PARSE: implement automated normalizations by parsing denormalized strings into complex objects (b) GENERATE: implement automated to_string labeling of complex objects For example, a Measurement class may have 3 fields: unit, value, and string_value.

For example, given a (generic) class Concept with slots id and label, it may be desirable to restrict the values the id takes on in a given context.

LinkML is a data modeling language for describing the structure of a collection of instances , where instances are tree-like object-oriented structures. Instances represent things of interest in a particular domain, such as individual people, biological samples, places, events, or abstract entities. Instances are either primitive types such as numbers or strings, or objects that are typed using classes from a LinkML schema . Classes are categories or groupings of things in the domain of interest; for example, Person , Medical History , Data file , or Country . Instances can be inter-related by assigning values to particular slots ; for example, an instance of a Person may have values for slots name or country of birth . LinkML schemas also specify rules for determining if instances conform to the schema, and for inference adding additional implicit slot values. LinkML is independent of any programming language, database technology, and is independent of any concrete form for serializing instances of schemas. Mappings are provided for serializing instances as JSON, YAML, RDF, flat tables, or relational models, or for mapping to programming language structures. However, the structure and semantics of LinkML are not dependent on any of these. Schemas are typically expressed using the YAML serialization, but this specification is defined independent of that particular serialization. LinkML is self-describing, and any LinkML schema is itself a collection instances that instantiates elements in a special schema called the LinkML metamodel . Audience This document is intended for LinkML tool and framework implementers, and is intended to formally specify the structure and semantics of LinkML.

The parts are not independent, as each part builds on concepts introduced in previous parts. Part 1: Introduction This section. Background information and preliminary definitions. Part 2: Structure and Syntax of Instances Part 2 provides a structural specification of LinkML instances . The structural specification is provided as a normative abstract functional-style syntax. UML diagrams are provided for informative purposes. This syntax is not intended as an actual exchange syntax for LinkML data. For that, existing syntaxes such as JSON, YAML, or RDF syntaxes should be used (see Part 6). The abstract syntax allows for a separation of the essential features of the language from issues related to any particular syntax. Part 2 also introduces a path accessor syntax for specifying how to traverse LinkML instances. The abstract syntax and path accessor syntax are used in the remainder of the specification. Part 3: Structure of Schemas Introduces the concept of a LinkML schema, which specifies how conforming LinkML instances are intended to be structured. This part specifies the core elements of a LinkML schema: ClassDefinitions , TypeDefinitions , SlotDefinitions , EnumDefinitions , as well as ancillary structures. This part also introduces the concept of the LinkML metamodel. A LinkML schema is both a specification of conformance conditions for an instance, and at the same time an instance that conforms to the metamodel schema.

A LinkML instance is a tree-like structure conforming to the syntax specified here. This syntax is not intended for data exchange, but instead for unambiguous describing data in LinkML in a way that is independent of any particular syntax. Section 6 specifies how the instance model is serialized as JSON, YAML, and RDF, and guidelines for mapping to object-oriented programming representations. This section uses BNF to define the structure of the LinkML instance abstract model. We also include UML-style diagrams for informative purposes. Instances An instance is a tree-like structure conforming to either one of four definition types, or a collection , or the special token None . The four definition types are subdivided into instances of classes (aka objects), or atomic instances: Instance := None | InstanceOfClass | AtomicInstance | CollectionInstance AtomicInstance := InstanceOfType | InstanceOfEnum | InstanceOfReference classDiagram Instance <|-- InstanceOfClass Instance <|-- AtomicInstance AtomicInstance <|-- InstanceOfReference AtomicInstance <|-- InstanceOfType AtomicInstance <|-- InstanceOfEnum Instance <|-- CollectionInstance Instance <-- None Definition Types and Names Definition names are used to unambiguously indicate elements specified in a Schema (described in Part 3 ): ClassDefinitionName := ElementName TypeDefinitionName := ElementName EnumDefinitionName := ElementName SlotDefinitionName := ElementName ElementName := a finite sequence of characters matching the PN_LOCAL production of SPARQL and not matching any of the keyword terminals of the syntax Names MUST NOT be shared across definition types Instances of Classes (Objects) An InstanceOfClass is a pair consisting of (1) a ClassDefinition Name that indicates the instantiation type of the instance, and (2) zero to many Assignments , where each assignment is a key-value pair of a SlotName and an Instance * value. InstanceOfClass := ClassDefinitionName '(' < Assignment >List ')' Assignment := SlotDefinitionName '=' Instance classDiagram Instance <|-- InstanceOfClass InstanceOfClass \"1\" --> \"1..*\" Assignment Assignment \"1\" --> Instance class InstanceOfClass { +ClassDefinitionName type +Assignment assignments } class Assignment { +SlotDefinitionName slot +Instance value } No SlotDefinitionName can appear twice in any set of Assignments (i.e. SlotDefinitionName is a key ) An example instance might be written in functional syntax as: Person(id=..., name=..., age=..., <other Assignments>) Here the ClassDefinitionName is Person , and the SlotDefinitionName s are id , name , age . Primitive (Atomic) Instances There are 3 types of primitive (aka atomic aka scalar) instances, each is a pair consisting of (1) a Name of the element instantiated (2) an atomic value. Different syntaxes are used to unambiguously distinguish the different types of primitive instances. InstanceOfType := TypeDefinitionName '^' AtomicValue InstanceOfEnum := EnumDefinitionName '[' PermissibleValue ']' PermissibleValue := AtomicValue InstanceOfReference := ClassDefinitionName '&' ObjectReference ObjectReference := AtomicValue classDiagram Instance <|-- AtomicInstance AtomicInstance <|-- InstanceOfReference AtomicInstance <|-- InstanceOfType AtomicInstance <|-- InstanceOfEnum class Instance { } class AtomicInstance { +AtomicValue value } class InstanceOfReference { +ClassDefinitionName type } class InstanceOfType { +TypeDefinitionName type } class InstanceOfEnum { +EnumDefinitionName type } Terminology note: Primitive instances are also known as \"literals\" or \"scalars\". Atomic Values An atomic value is either a string or number or boolean, where numbers can be floating points, decimals, or integers. AtomicValue := QuotedString | NumberValue | BooleanValue QuotedString := '\"' StringValue '\"' StringValue := a finite sequence of characters in which \" (U+22) and \\ (U+5C) occur only in pairs of the form \\\" (U+5C, U+22) and \\ (U+5C, U+5C), enclosed in a pair of \" (U+22) characters NumberValue := FloatingPointValue | DecimalValue | IntegerValue FloatingPointValue ::= [ '+' | '-'] ( Digits ['.' Digits ] [ Exponent ] | '.' Digits [ Exponent ]) ( 'f' | 'F' ) Exponent ::= ('e' | 'E') ['+' | '-'] Digits DecimalValue ::= ['+' | '-'] Digits '.' Digits IntegerValue ::= ['+' | '-'] Digits NonNegativeInteger ::= Zero | PositiveInteger PositiveInteger ::= NonZero { Digit } Digits ::= Digit { Digit } Digit ::= Zero | NonZero NonZero := '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9' Zero ::= '0' BooleanValue ::= 'True' | 'False' Examples of atomic values are: 180.2 -- a DecimalValue 5 -- an IntegerValue \"Alex\" -- a StringValue True -- a BooleanValue \"2023-01-01\" -- a StringValue (which happens to be interpetable as a date) Atomic Instance Examples An InstanceOfType instance might look like: Integer^23 In this example, the TypeDefinitionName is Integer , and the AtomicValue is the number 23 . Note that this is necessarily a syntactically valid Instance according to this part of the specification. Part 6 describes schema-level validation, and for this to be valid according to a schema, that schema must (a) provide a TypeDefinition with the name \"Integer\" (b) map this to an XSD number type (presumably, xsd:integer). Note that the following is syntactically valid : Integer^\"ABC\" If Integer is a TypeDefinition that is mapped to the XSD type for integers, then this will be invalid according to the schema, but at the syntactic level the structure is valid.

An example of a syntactically valid InstanceOfReference : Person&\"SSN:456\" This is syntactically valid, but for it to be valid according to a schema, the schema must include a ClassDefinition with the name Person , and that ClassDefinition must have an identifier (see Part 6).

For precise semantic interpretation of these structures, refer to the following two parts on derived schemas (part 4) and validation (part 5). Schema Basics A LinkML schema specifies rules and structural conformance conditions for instances . Schemas allow for: parsing of instance serializations to LinkML instances structurally and semantically validating LinkML instances inference of missing values in LinkML instances The LinkML Metamodel Every LinkML schema m is itself an instance of a special class SchemaDefinition that forms part of a special schema called the LinkML metamodel , which is denoted by m M . There is exactly one metamodel. In this specification: ClassDefinitions in m M are called metaclasses SlotDefinitions in m M are called metaslots The metamodel is itself expressed in LinkML, and the latest version can found from canonical URLs: https://w3id.org/linkml/SchemaDefinition -- top level class https://w3id.org/linkml/meta.yaml -- canonical YAML serialization of the metamodel This specification specifies the normative elements necessary to specify the behavior of LinkML schemas. Schemas may have additional elements provided in the metamodel. For example, elements in schemas can have informative slot assignments for slots such as title , description , and so on, but these slots are not described in this specification as they are not normative and do not affect the formal interpretation of schemas. The subset of the metamodel that corresponds to the specification is called the SpecificationProfile, and it is found at: https://w3id.org/linkml/SpecificationSubset YAML representation of schemas This part of the specification specifies schemas in terms of the abstract functional syntax (part 2). For practical purposes, the canonical serialization of a schema is in YAML. The rules for serializing and deserializing LinkML schemas are the same as for instances, because every schema is an object that instantiates a SchemaDefinition class in the metamodel. See section 6 for rules for mapping to YAML. Analogies to other modeling frameworks To help understand the basic concepts, it can be helpful to think about analogous structures in other frameworks. However, it should be understood these are not precisely equivalent. ClassDefinitions are analogous to: classes in object-oriented languages tables in relational databases and spreadsheets owl:Class entities in RDFS/OWL SlotDefinitions are analogous to: attributes in object-oriented languages columns or fields in relational databases and spreadsheets properties in JSON-Schema rdf:Property entities in RDFS/OWL EnumDefinitions are analogous to: enumerated types in programming languages and some relational systems drop-down selections in spreadsheets Note however that in LinkML enums are optionally backed by stronger semantics with enum elements (permissible values) mapped to vocabularies or ontologies TypeDefinitions are analogous to: data types in most object-oriented languages primitive types in database systems extensible types in some systems rdf:Literals in RDF Datatypes in OWL SchemaDefinition Metaclass metamodel documentation: SchemaDefinition SchemaDefinition: Normative subset metaslots A schema m is an instance of a SchemaDefinition, with normative elements: Name Cardinality and Range Description id 1..1 xsd:anyURI The official schema URI name 1..1 xsd:string a unique name for the schema that is both human-readable and consists of only... identifier classes 0..* ClassDefinition An index to the collection of all class definitions in the schema slot_definitions 0..* SlotDefinition An index to the collection of all slot definitions in the schema enums 0..* EnumDefinition An index to the collection of all enum definitions in the schema subsets 0..* SubsetDefinition An index to the collection of all subset definitions in the schema prefixes 0..* Prefix prefix / URI definitions to be added to the context beyond those fetched from... default_prefix 0..1 xsd:string default and base prefix -- used for ':' identifiers, @base and @vocab default_range 0..1 TypeDefinition default slot range to be used if range element is omitted from a slot definitition... settings 0..* Setting A collection of global variable settings imports 0..* xsd:anyURI other schemas that are included in this schema rank 0..1 xsd:integer the relative order in which the element occurs, lower values are given ... id_prefixes 0..* xsd:string the identifier of this class or slot must begin with the URIs referenced by ... from_schema 0..1 xsd:anyURI id of the schema that defined the element SchemaDefinition: Normative subset UML A subset of the above normative slots are depicted as follows: classDiagram SchemaDefinition \"1\" --> \"*\" ClassDefinition: classes SchemaDefinition \"1\" --> \"*\" SlotDefinition: slots SchemaDefinition \"1\" --> \"*\" EnumDefinition: enums SchemaDefinition \"1\" --> \"*\" SubsetDefinition: subsets SchemaDefinition \"1\" --> \"*\" Prefix: prefixes ClassDefinition --|> Element SlotDefinition --|> Element EnumDefinition --|> Element EnumDefinition --|> Element class SchemaDefinition { +Uri id +NcName name +UriOrCurie[] imports +Ncname default_prefix +Uri default_range } Schema example, functional syntax The skeleton of a schema instance serialized as in functional syntax might look like: SchemaDefinition( id=String^\"http://example.org/organization\", imports=[...], prefixes=[...], classes=[...], slots=[...], enums=[...], types=[...], ) Schema example, YAML The skeleton of the above schema instance serialized as YAML might look like: id: http://example.org/personinfo imports: ... prefixes: ... classes: ... slots: ... enums: ... types: ... ClassDefinition Metaclass metamodel documentation: ClassDefinition Instances of ClassDefinition are themselves instantiable . For example, a schema may contain a class definition \"Person\".

Objectidentifier (ElementIdentifier) - A URI or CURIE that represents an object in the model. String (str) - A character string Time (XSDTime) - A time object represents a (local) time of day, independent of any particular day Uri (URI) - a complete URI Uriorcurie (URIorCURIE) - a URI or a CURIE The type schema can be imported, used directly, or used as a basis to extend new types ClassDefinitionReference Metaclass ClassDefinitionReferences are primitive elements that provide a way to reference a particular instances. ClassDefinitionReferences are not part of the asserted schema but are derived from derivation rules -- see next section Prefix Metaclass metamodel documentation: Prefix A schema can contain any number of prefixes. Each prefix maps a short name such as \"owl\" to a URI. These are used to determine the canonical URI for any element.

This might be depicted in UML as: classDiagram Person \"0\" --> \"*\" Person: knows class Person { +String id +String name +Float height +Date date_of_birth +JobCode occupation } This would have a YAML serialization (see section 6): classes: Person: description: ... slots: - id - name - height - date_of_birth - occupation - knows slots: id: identifier: true range: string name: range: string date_of_birth: range: date height: range: float occupation: range: JobCode knows: range: Person multivalued: true enums: JobCode: permissible_values: ForkliftDriver: ...: types: date: ...

Conventions We use m to denote the input or asserted schema (model), and m D to denote the derived schema Informative Example We provide a non-normative example of a schema in canonical YAML. This will be referred to in the remainder of the document. The schema is organized in a local folder as follows: person.yaml: id: https://w3id.org/linkml/examples/person name: person prefixes: person: https://w3id.org/linkml/examples/person linkml: https://w3id.org/linkml/ default_prefix: person imports: - linkml:types - core classes: Person: is_a: NameThing description: >- A person, living or dead slots: - age_in_years - vital_status slots: age_in_years: description: >- The age of a person in years range: integer multivalued: false vital_status: description: >- The vital status of a person range: VitalStatusEnum enums: VitalStatusEnum: description: >- The vital status of a person permissible_values: ALIVE: DECEASED: core.yaml: id: https://w3id.org/linkml/examples/core name: person-core prefixes: person: https://w3id.org/linkml/examples/person linkml: https://w3id.org/linkml/ default_prefix: person imports: - linkml:types classes: NamedThing: attributes: id: range: string identifier: true name: range: string ... Functions This section defines functions that can be used in schema derivation rules. Normalize as List Function The function L ( v ) normalizes v to a list/collection: v L ( v ) None [] [v1, v2, ...] [v1, v2, ...] v if no preceding matches apply [v] i.e. L(v) = [] if v == None v if v == [...] [v] otherwise Identifier Value Function The function K ( v ) returns the identifier value of an InstanceOfClassDefinition , if present, otherwise None In the metamodel, the identifier SlotDefinitionName is always name , so this can be calculated: K ( v ) = v . name URI and CURIE functions a CURIE is a string that conforms to the W3 CURIE specification a URI is a string that conforms to rfc3987 The function URI ( s , v ) takes a string as input and normalizes it to a URI if the input is already a URI, then return it if the input is a CURIE, then expand it using the prefix map in s ; this is known as expansion The function CURIE ( s , v ) takes a string as input and normalizes it to a CURIE if the input is already a CURIE, then return it if the input is a URI, then shorten it using the prefix map in s ; this is known as contraction When a CURIE is expanded, it is first decomposed according to the grammar defined in W3 CURIE specification : curie := [ [ prefix ] ':' ] reference prefix := NCName reference := irelative-ref (as defined in IRI ) The following concatenation is applied URI ( <prefix> : <reference> ) = m.prefixes [ prefix ] .prefix_reference + <reference> For the reverse operation, any URI that starts with a prefix reference can be used to generate a valid CURIE. The one with the shortest reference is chosen as the canonical. Resolve Functions The function Resolve takes as input a InstanceOfReference and returns an InstanceOfClass that is the referenced object. i Resolve ( i ) SlotDefinition&<V> m.slots[<V>] ClassDefinition&<V> m.classes[<V>] EnumDefinition&<V> m.enums[<V>] TypeDefinition&<V> m.types[<V>] SchemaDefinition&<V> see below The rules for schema resolution are as follows: Determine the location of V , which may be on the local file system or on a network if V is in a user-supplied import map , then look up this value if V is a URL, then retrieve from this location if V is a CURIE, then expand using the rules below, and retrieve from this location otherwise retrieve from local file system, relative to the current schema, assuming a .yaml suffix Load the YAML file at this location following the rules for parsing YAML in Part 6, yielding a SchemaDefinition instance. Examples: i Resolve ( i ) in m D ClassDefinition&Person m.classes[\"Person\"] = ClassDefinition(name=\"Person\", ...) SlotDefinition&vital_status m.slots[\"vital_status\"] = SlotDefinition(name=\"vital_status\", ...) Lookup Functions The notation i . <slot> denotes a function that looks up the slot assignment slot in instance i . If i is a InstanceOfReference it is first Resolved , as per the table above. If i is collection of references, then each element is resolved. Closure Function The function C ( e , f ) takes as input an element e and a function f and returns the mathematical closure of f C(e, f) = { f(e) } U { f(e') | e' in C(e, f) } The ReflexiveClosure C * includes e C*(e, f) = C(e, f) U { e } Function: Parents Parents itself is the union of is_a and mixins , plus the builtin ClassDefinition Any : P ( e ) = L ( e . is_a ) \u222a L ( e . mixins ) } \u222a { Any } Function: Ancestors The ancestors function A returns the Closure of the Parents function A ( e ) = C ( e , P ) The function ReflexiveAncestors A uses the ReflexiveClosure *. A ( e ) = C ( e , P**) Function: Imports Closure The imports closure function I returns the reflexive ReferenceClosure of the direct imports. I ( s ) = C ( s , s.imports *) Function: Element CURIEs and URIs For each element in the schema, we can derive a model URI and an element URI. These may be identical. The following table is used: Type Element URI Model URI ClassDefinition e.class_uri <m.default_prefix>:<SafeCamel(e.name)> SlotDefinition e.slot_uri <m.default_prefix>:<SafeSnake(e.name)> TypeDefinition e.uri <m.default_prefix>:<SafeCamel(e.name)> EnumDefinition e.enum_uri <m.default_prefix>:<SafeCamel(e.name)> PermissibleValue e.meaning ModelURI(Enum) + \".\" + Safe(e.text) If the element URI slot is not set, then the model URI is used as the element URI. URIs can be contracted to CURIEs using the prefixes map in the model, see next function. Function: Applicable Slots The applicable slots for a class are all valid slots to use for an instance of that class. It is the set of all direct slots for that class and its ancestors. ApplicableSlots ( c ) = c' \u2208 A ( c ) DirectSlots ( c'*) DirectSlots(c) = L (c. slots ) \u222a L (c. attributes ) Algorithm: Combine Slots The combine slot algorithm takes two slots s1 and s2. s1 is assumed to have precedence over s2. CombineSlots(s1, s2) = s = SlotDefinition() for ms in MetaModel.slots: s.ms = CombineSlotsMetaslots(ms, s1.ms, s2.ms) The CombineSlotsMetaslots function is evaluated by looking up the table below: metaslot v1 v2 expression v v v None v2 v2 v1 None v1 .name == maximum_value min(v1,v2) .name == minimum_value max(v1,v2) .name == pattern CombinePattern(v1,v2) .name == range A ( r1 ) \u2229 A ( r2 ) .multivalued == True L(v1) U L(v2) .range == boolean v1 OR v2 v1 The preconditions are matched in order of precedence, thus if no preconditions save the last one match, then the value is taken from the first, higher precedence slot. Algorithm: Combine Schemas Two schemas combined by combining their individual elements CombineSchemas(m1, m2): m = SchemaDefinition() m.classes = CombineElements(m1.classes, m2.classes) m.types = CombineElements(m1.types, m2.types) m.slots = CombineElements(m1.slots, m2.slots) m.enums = CombineElements(m1.enums, m2.enums) m.subsets = CombineElements(m1.subsets, m2.subsets) CombineElements(E1, E2): E1ids = { e.id for e in E1 } E2ids = { e.id for e in E2 } for e in E1: if e.id in E2ids: raise Error else: yield e for e in E2: if e.id in E1ids: raise Error else: yield e Algorithm: Calculate Derived Slot DerivedSlot( s , c ) takes a slot definition name s and a class definition name c and returns a derived slot that is pre-populated with the appropriate inferred values. The procedure first applies slot usage and attributes from the class and its ancestors, then it applies top level slot definitions for that slot and the slot ancestors. In the latter case, only metaslots marked inheritable are propagated. DerivedSlot(m,s,c): d = SlotDefinition(name=s, alias=s) ApplySlotUsage(d,s,c) if s in m.slots: d = CombineSlots(d, m.slots[s]) for s' in A(s): for ms in MetaModel.slots: if ms.inheritable: d.ms = CombineSlotsMetaslots(ms, d.ms, m.slots[s'].ms) AddMissingValues(d, c) return d The ApplySlotUsage function iteratively combines the value of the slot_usage and attributes metaslots for a class, and then for class ancestors, with mixins having priority. ApplySlotUsage(d, s, c): for s' in { c.slot_usage, c.attributes} s' = CombineSlots(d, s') for c' in **L**(c.`mixins`) \u222a **L**(c.`is_a`) ApplySlotUsage(d, s, c') The function AddMissingValues(s, c) is calculated for a SlotDefinition according to the following table Preconditions Postconditions s.inlined_as_dict=True s.inlined=True PK(c)=None s.inlined=True Algorithm: Calculate Permissible Values The set of permissible values for an Enum may be specified as a static fixes list OR as a dynamic query OR both PVs(e): pvs = Texts(e.permissible_values) for e' in e.inherits: pvs = pvs U PVs(e') for e' in e.minus: pvs = pvs - PVs(e') for pv in e.concepts: pvs = pvs U pv for q in e.reachable_from: pvs = pvs U ResolveQuery(q) The ResolveQuery applied to q operates over an external ontology of vocabulary resource indicated by r.source_ontology . Each such ontology has a graph presentation which the query is resolved against. Each resource may choose to present itself as a graph in an application specific way. For OWL ontologies, it is recommended that the OWL TBox is presented as a graph following the Relation Graph pattern, i.e. axioms such as A SubClassOf R some B are presented as edges from A to B with label R . ResolveQuery(q: EnumExpression): G = as_graph(q.source_ontology) G = FilterEdges(p in g.relationship_types) pvs = {} for n in q.source_nodes pvs = pvs U Closure(G, parent, n) if q.reflexive: pvs = pvs U {n} return pvs Derivation Rules The following rules are applied to deduce a derived schema m D . Rule: Ensure Metamodel ids are unique Each m' in I ( m ) must have a unique identifier, m'.id . not exists m' in I ( m ) and m' in I ( m ) and m'.id == m'.id Rule: Populate Schema Metadata For each m' in I ( m ), populate the following metamodel slots: for each element e in m' , set e.from_schema to m' if m'.default_range is not set, set it to string . Rule: Combine Import Closure A derived model m D is the result of combining the import closure of m : m D = Aggregate ( CombineSchemas , I ( m )) When copying an element x from an import into m D , the name x.name must be unique - if the same name has been used in another model, the derivation procedure fails, and an error is thrown. Rule: Derived Attributes Derived attributes are populated by applying the DerivedSlot algorithm to each applicable slot for any class for c in m.classes: for s in ApplicableSlots(c): d = DerivedSlot(m,s,c) c.attributes[s] = d Rule: Derived Class and Slot URIs For each class or slot, if a class_uri or slot_uri is not specified, then this is derived using the rules specified for Element URIs above. For example, given: prefixes: foo: http://example.org/foo/ bar: http://example.org/bar/ default_prefix: foo classes: A: class_uri: bar:A ... B: ... the following values would be set: A.class_uri = http://example.org/bar/A B.class_uri = http://example.org/foo/B Rule: Derived Permissible Values TODO Rule: Generation of patterns from structured patterns For any slot s , if s.structured_pattern = p and p is not None then s.pattern is assigned a value based on the following procedure: If p.interpolated is True, then the value of s.syntax is interpolated , by replacing all occurrences of braced text {VAR} with the value of VAR . The value of VAR is obtained using m.settings[VAR] , where m is the schema in which p is introduced. If p.interpolated is not True, then the value of s.syntax is used directly. If p.partial_match is not True, then s.pattern has a '^' character inserted at the beginning and a '$' character inserted as the end. Structural Conformance Rules This section specifies conformance rules which the derived schema must satisfy. Note that some of these rules may be derivable from treating the schema as an instance of the metamodel and applying validation rules in part 5, but we still list them below for completeness. Rule: Each referenced entity must be present Every ClassDefinition , ClassDefinitionReference , SlotDefinitionReference , EnumDefinitionReference , and TypeDefinitionReference must be resolvable within m D However, not every element needs to be referenced. For example, it is valid to have a list of SlotDefinitions that are never used in m D . ClassDefinition Structural Conformance Rules Each c in m D .classes must conform to the rules below: c must be an instance of a ClassDefinition c must have a unique name c.name , and this name must not be shared by any other class or element in m D c lists permissible slots in c.slots , the range of this is a reference to a SlotDefinition in m D .slots c defines how slots are used in the context of c via a collection of SlotDefinitions specified in c.slot_usage c may define local slots using c.attributes , the value of this is a. collection of SlotDefinitions c may have certain boolean properties defined such as c.mixin and c.abstract c must have exactly one value for c.class_uri in m D , and the value must be an instance of the builtin type UriOrCurie c may have parent ClassDefinitions defined via c.is_a and c.mixins the value of c.is_a must be a ClassDefinitionReference the value of c.mixins must be a collection of ClassDefinitonReferences For any parent p of c , if p.mixin is True, then c.mixin SHOULD be True c includes additional rules in c.rules and c.classificiation_rules c may have any number of additional slot-value assignments consistent with the validation rules provided here with the metamodel MM SlotDefinition Structural Conformance Rules Each s in m D .slots must conform to the rules below: s must be an instance of a SlotDefinition s must have a unique name s.name , and this name must not be shared by any other type or element s must have a range specified via s.range in m D s may have an assignment s.identifier which is True if s plays the role of a unique identifier s may have certain boolean properties defined such as s.mixin and s.abstract s must have exactly one value for s.slot_uri in m D , and the value must be an instance of the builtin type UriOrCurie s may have parent SlotDefinitions defined via s.is_a and s.mixins the value of s.is_a must be a SlotDefinitionReference the value of s.mixins must be a collection of SlotDefinitionReference s For any parent p of s , if p.mixin is True, then s.mixin SHOULD be True s may have any number of additional slot-value assignments consistent with the validation rules provided here with the metamodel MM TypeDefinition Structural Conformance Rules Each s in m D .types must conform to the rules below: t must be an instance of a TypeDefinition t must have a unique name t.name , and this name must not be shared by any other type or element t must have a mapping to an xsd type provided via t.uri in m D t may have a parent type declared via t.typeof t may have any number of additional slot-value assignments consistent with the validation rules provided here with the metamodel MM EnumDefinition Structural Conformance Rules Each e in m D .enums must conform to the rules below: e must be an instance of a EnumDefinition e must have a unique name e.name , and this name must not be shared by any other enum or element e lists all static permissible values via e.permissible_values , the value of which is a list of instances of the MM class PermissibleValue e may have any number of additional slot-value assignments consistent with the validation rules provided here with the metamodel MM ClassDefinitionReference Structural Conformance Rules Each r in m D .class_references must conform to the rules below: r must be an instance of a ClassDefinitionReference r must have a unique name r.name , and this name must not be shared by any other type or element Metamodel Conformance Rules Both the asserted and derived schema should be valid instances of the LinkML metamodel MM using the instance validation rules described in the next section","title":"Derived Schemas"},{"location":"docs/specification/04derived-schemas/#derived-schemas","text":"This section describes rules that can be applied to a schema to obtain a derived schema.

As such, it can be validated in the same way as any other LinkML instance. Metamodel refinement using annotations Background The LinkML model provides a fixed set of metamodel slots which can be applied to any schema element. Any schema that assigns slot values not in the metamodel is invalid. Sometimes it is useful to attach additional information to elements in a schema, this is called schema extension . Alternatively, it may be useful to be able to make the metamodel more restrictive in some contexts; for example, making the description metamodel slot required rather than recommended . The LinkML metamodel can be effectively extended through the use of annotation slot assignments. Annotations are tag - value pairs. As an example, if we want to add a metamodel slot review intended to store a review of a schema element. classes: Person: annotations: review: A very useful class that is well defined ... Annotation validation By default, all annotation tags and values are valid. LinkML 1.6 introduces the ability to validate annotation tags and values. This is done by adding an instantiates slot-value assignment onto any schema element. The range of the instantiates slot is a uriorcurie that references a class that serves as a metamodel extension class. If a schema element instantiates at least one class then all annotations are validated. For example: classes: Person: instantiates: - mymetamodel:Reviewable annotations: review: A very useful class that is well defined ... The Reviewable class is defined as follows: classes: Reviewable: class_uri: mymetamodel:Reviewable slots: description: an expert review of a schema element review: string","title":"Instance Validation"},{"location":"docs/specification/05validation/#validation-using-schemas","text":"Validation is a procedure that takes as input a LinkML instance and a schema, and will run a collection of checks against that instance.

The formal specification of LinkML instances is described in Section 2 . LinkML instances can be realized in a number of different concrete forms, including: tree-shaped serializations such as JSON or YAML graph serializations such as RDF in-memory programmatic typed object representations, such as Python dataclass instances or java objects. Tables in a relational database flattened tabular representations This part of the LinkML specification only deals with 1-3. Future versions of the specification may also include 4-5. Terminology a mapping describes how the abstract LinkML instance model maps to a concrete form and back dumping or serialization is the process realizing a mapping from a programmatic representation to a serialization syntax conversion is the processing of converting between one serialization and another a lossy mapping is one that is not guaranteed to preserve all information Implementations As the functional syntax is only intended for specification purposes, it is not expected that implementations use this as an intermediate. Instead, it is expected that an implementation will go via an internal programmatic representation. The reference implementation is the linkml-runtime but other implementations that conform to this specification are valid. Mapping to JSON or YAML Here we define a mapping of LinkML instances to JSON. note on YAML As JSON is a subset of YAML, this can also be used to load and dump from YAML. This is the canonical YAML mapping. We leave open the possibility of a direct YAML conversion in future which makes use of YAML tags to encode typing information. Mapping to JSON: Overview Serialization to JSON takes as input: a (root) instance Parsing from JSON takes as input: a JSON document a target ElementName a SchemaDefinition The following table defines a translation function tr J ( i ) that maps LinkML instances to JSON. To apply this, i is matched against the instance column, and if a match is found, the production rule on the right hand side is applied. Instance JSON None null <TypeDefinitionName>&<StringValue> string(<StringValue>) <TypeDefinitionName>&<NumberValue> number(<AtomicValue>) <TypeDefinitionName>&<BooleanValue> bool(<AtomicValue>) <EnumDefinitionName>[<PermissibleValue>] <PermissibleValue> <ClassDefinitionName>&<StringValue> string(<StringValue>) <ClassDefinitionName>&<NumberValue> number(<NumberValue>) <ClassDefinitionName>(<s1>=<v1>, ..., <sN>=<vN>) object(string(s1)=trJ(v1), ..., string(sN)=trJ(vN)) [<Values>] See below the functions object and number and string apply as per the definitions here Collection Forms There are 4 different forms in which a LinkML collection can be serialized as JSON. These forms only apply to lists uniformly consisting of InstanceOfClass objects. Form JSON SimpleDict object( K(i1): tr(V(i1)), ..., K(iN): tr(V(iN)) ) CompactDict object( K(i1): tr(i1) - {PK: K(i1), ..., K(iN): tr(iN) - {PK: K(iN)} ) ExpandedDict object( K(i1): tr(i1), ..., K(iN): tr(iN) ) List '[' tr(i1), ..., tr(iN) ']' This is determined in part by the parent slot s If s.inlined_as_dict == False then the form is List If s.inlined_as_dict == True then the form is SimpleDict or CompactDict or ExpandedDict If s.inlined_as_simple_dict == True then the form is SimpleDict If s.inlined_as_simple_dict == False then the form is CompactDict or ExpandedDict If s.inlined_as_expanded_dict == True then the form is ExpandedDict If s.inlined_as_expanded_dict == False then the form is CompactDict Note that inlined_as_simple_dict and inlined_as_expanded_dict are only explicitly added to the metamodel in LinkML 1.5 and above. Prior to 1.5 these are calculated as follows: inlined_as_simple_dict is True if inlined_as_dict is True, and the derived model has a total of two attributes (one of which is the key) inlined_as_expanded_dict is False Collection Form Normalization Normalization is the process of translating or coercing one form to the canonical form. There are 12 non-identity normalizations possible, according to this table: Source Form Target Form Repair? List SimpleDict True List CompactDict True List ExpandedDict True SimpleDict List True SimpleDict CompactDict False SimpleDict ExpandedDict False CompactDict List True CompactDict SimpleDict False CompactDict ExpandedDict False ExpandedDict List True ExpandedDict SimpleDict False ExpandedDict CompactDict False Additionally, the process of converting between a list of length 1 and a singleton, or the reverse translation, is considered a Repair normalization. JSON Parsers MUST implement normalizations where Repair=False. These indicate alternative valid serializations. JSON Parsers MAY choose to implement Repair normalizations. If they choose to implement these, there SHOULD be a way to allow the user to disable these repairs. Validators that take JSON as input SHOULD perform normalizations where Repair=False. These normalizations SHOULD be reported as part of the validation report, and MUST NOT be counted as validation errors. Validators MAY perform normalization of Repair=True normalizations, if they do, they MUST report these as errors. Mapping from JSON Mapping to JSON is potentially lossy, as the definition names are not preserved. When mapping from JSON, the function is tr -1 J ( obj , target ) where target is a schema element. The same table as above is used, but an additional inference rule is applied when the target is a ClassDefinitionName . First a deepening procedure is applied. If target has an induced slot s t such as that s t .designates_type is True , then the value of obj. s t is used to determine the type of the instance. If the range of s t is a TypeDefinition uriorcurie then the ClassDefinitionName is indexed by the uriorcurie of the class If the range of s t is a TypeDefinition with uri xsd:anyURI then the ClassDefinitionName is indexed by the URI of the class Otherwise the value of the s t is the target class name For each assignment, the induced slot s is calculated (see section 5 of the specification), and s.range is used for the target of subsequent calls to tr -1 J ( obj , target ). Translation to RDF Two RDF translations can be specified: A direct translation Translation via JSON-LD, which combines Translation of a LinkML SchemaDefinition to a JSON-LD Context The standard translation of LinkML instances to JSON Both translations make use of the prefixes provided in the schema The semantic content of both is equivalent. Mapping of CURIEs to URIs LinkML provides standard types: Curie Uri Curieoruri The syntax for a CURIE is defined by W3C CURIE Syntax 1.0 curie := [ [ prefix ] ':' ] reference prefix := NCName reference := irelative-ref See the Part 5 for rules for generating CURIEs and URIs from schema elements. Mapping functions The following three functions are used when mapping LinkML instances to RDF: Function Value Literal( v , T ) \"<v>\"^^T.uri Node( v ) URI(<v>) Pred( p ) URI(p.slot_uri) Subj( i ) URI(K(i)) or Blank Direct Translation of instance graphs to RDF A translation Tr R operates on an instance i , which is matched against the first column here, generating triples in the second column, and returning the value in the final column. i Triples Returns None {} None <Type>&<V> {} Literal(V, Type) <Enum>[<PV>] where PV.meaning=None {} Literal(V, Type) <Enum>[<PV>] where PV.meaning!==None {} Node(PV.meaning) <Class>&<V> {} Node(V) <Class>(<s1>=<v1>, ..., <sN>=<vN>) <Subj(i) Pred(si) L(tr(vi))> for i in 1..N Subj(i) The triple generator column contains either the empty list or rules to generate triples. The templates <s p L(o)> denotes a triple <s p oi> for each oi in L(o) . Translation of instance graphs to RDF graphs (via JSON-LD) This is an alternative specification of a mapping to RDF, specified in terms of a mapping to JSON-LD. The mapping to JSON-LD is in two parts: mapping the instance to JSON-LD mapping the derived schema to a JSON-LD context For (1), the mapping is the same as in \"Mapping to JSON\", above, with the addition of the insertion of a @context key-value pair into the top level object. For (2), a JSON-LD context is generated by walking the entire derived SchemaDefinition object applying matches in the table below: Schema Element Match Context Key Context Value SchemaDefinition p in e.prefixes | p.prefix_prefix | @id= @prefix=true` SchemaDefinition s in e.slots s.name @type=<s.type.uri> SchemaDefinition s in e.slots s.name @id=URI(<s.slot_uri>) SchemaDefinition s in e.slots , s.inlined=True s.name @id=URI(<s.slot_uri>) SchemaDefinition c in e.classes c.name @id=URI(<s.class_uri>) ` ClassDefinition s in e.attributes s.name @type=<s.type.uri> ClassDefinition s in e.attributes s.name @id=URI(<s.slot_uri>) ClassDefinition s in e.attributes , s.inlined=True s.name @id=URI(<s.slot_uri>) Mapping to Typed Objects Different programming languages have different formalisms for representing objects. We specify a generic mapping to an abstract typed object representation, which can be mapped to the native object representation of a given language. The mapping to Typed Objects is similar to the mapping to JSON, with the addition that each node in the tree has an ElementName (type) associated with it. Instance TypedObject None null <TypeDefinitionName>&<Value> <TypeDefinitionName>(<Value>) <EnumDefinitionName>[<PermissibleValue>] <EnumDefinitionName>(<PermissibleValue>) <ClassDefinitionName>&<Value> REF(<ClassDefinitionName>)(<Value>) <ClassDefinitionName>(<s1>=<v1>, ..., <sN>=<vN>) <ClassDefinitionName>(s1=trO(v1), ..., sN=trO(vN)) [<Values>] As for JSON The function REF takes a ClassDefinitionName and returns a function that returns the name of an atomic class by concatenating the ClassDefinitionName with the name of PK(ClassDefinitionName) using the naming conventions of the target language. For example, if the class Person has an attribute id marked identifier=True then REF(Person) returns PersonId , assuming CamelCase naming conventions.

This allows for code generation , in which a LinkML schema is used as the source to generate code in a target language. This has a number of advantages, including type safety, programmer efficiency, ease of mapping to other serializations, helping ensure code and domain models are aligned. As each programming language differs in which constructs it offers and the precise semantics of these constructs, there is single standard for mapping. Instead, we provide a set of general recommendations that can be adapted to each language. Terminology Programming language constructs: Structure : a compound datatype that consists of one of more attributes Class : a Structure that supports or partially supports inheritance Attribute : a field or property of a class or struct Class-level variable : a property of a class rather than of an instance of that class Module : A file-level bundle of classes or structures Package : A collection of modules Mapping of LinkML Schemas Schemas to Modules A schema SHOULD be mapped to EITHER a module or a collection of modules, depending on the idioms of the target language. For languages where it is conventional to include multiple classes or structures in a single module (e.g. Python), the schema SHOULD correspond to a module. For languages where it is conventional to include a single classes or structures in a single module (e.g. Java), a single module will correspond to a single LinkML class or enum. Current implementations: Target Default Mapping Dataclasses One file per schema Pydantic One file per schema Java One file per class Typescript One file per schema Imports A mapping MAY choose to merge imports prior to code generation. If imports are not merged, then each imports in the SchemaDefinition MUST be mapped to an import statement in the target language. Where modules correspond to structures, there SHOULD be one import in the target language module for every import in the source LinkML schema. Mappings MAY choose to selectively import via inspection of all used elements. Naming Conventions for Modules There MUST be a correspondence between schema name and module name. The mapping MAY prioritize idioms of the target language over LinkML idioms, although the mapping MUST be deterministic. For example, if the target language has module names as CamelCase then a mapping MAY translate all module names using a standard camel case string transformation. Schema level metadata MAY be included in the header of the module. This MAY be as comments, but if the target language supports module-level variables or other ways to make schema metadata introspectable at runtime, these mechanisms SHOULD be used. Current implementations: Target Default Mapping Dataclasses underscore Pydantic underscore Java CamelCase Typescript CamelCase Mapping of LinkML Classes Target Constructs Different languages support different constructs, which may all make appropriate targets for LinkML classes. For example: Java has both Interfaces and Classes, and newer versions of Java support Records Scala has traits and sealed traits Rust has structs, traits, and enums Typescript has classes and interfaces The choice should reflect whatever is most idiomatic for the target language. The generation MAY allow for different mappings, controlled by either user configuration, or by properties of either the schema and its elements. For example, when mapping to Rust, a generator MAY choose to map to either structs or to struct/enum/trait combinations, depending on whether polymorphism is used in the schema. A mapping MAY be non-isomorphic (i.e not one-to-one). For example, in languages that have a split between interface-like constructs and concrete class-like constructs, a generator MAY choose to implement a mapping where each LinkML class creates both structures, in order to leverage the full benefits of the target language. Class level variables A generator SHOULD map certain properties of schema elements to class level variables where the target language allows. When this mapping occurs, the names of the class level variables MUST correspond to LinkML metamodel elements, allowing for translation to language idioms. The following class-level variables are recommended: class_class_uri: the semantic URI of the class, as defined by class_uri class_class_curie: the CURIE form of class_class_uri class_name: the normalized name of the LinkML class, corresponding to the name of the class class_model_uri: the URI of the class within the namespace of the schema A generator MAY allow for generation of class level variables to be suppressed. A generator MAY choose to use annotations in place of class-level variables Current implementations: Target Default Mapping Dataclasses all Pydantic none (planned) Java none (planned) Typescript none Inheritance Mapping of is_a and mixins may be dependent on properties of target language constructs. Generators MAY choose to roll-down attributes from parent classes. If the target construct for a class supports single inheritance, then the is_a SHOULD correspond to the analogous construct (for example, extends in Java). The mixins MAY be represented using an alternative construct (such as implements in Java). Generators MAY choose to create type checkers for runtime inspection of instantiated classes. This SHOULD NOT be done in languages that support polymorphism and type checking natively (for example isinstance in Python) Mapping of class slots and attributes Mapping of class slots and attributes should be entailment-preserving, such that the semantics of the generated code in the target language corresponds to a derived schema. For example, consider a schema with classes: classes: NamedThing: attributes: id: Person: is_a: NamedThing attributes: address: The following are both valid ways to map Person to a target language construct: a non-class structure with two asserted attributes, id and address (the address has been \"rolled down\") a class structure whose structure mirrors the source LinkML, with id only asserted on the parent Constructors Generation of constructors will be highly dependent on source language, but the following guidelines should be followed: if the target language allows named assignment of attributes, then this SHOULD be the default constructor style if the target language allows positional assignment of attributes, then this MAY be allowed: the order of attributes MUST correspond to rank metaslots in the derived schema, if specified otherwise the ordering MUST correspond to the order in which slots or attributes are specified starting from the is_a root, working down the is_a hierarchy slots order prioritized over attributes if the target language and idiom uses builder patterns then these may be used Mapping of schema-level slots Mapping of constraints and rules Constraints and rules in LinkML SHOULD be mapped to declarative target constructs where possible. If this is not possible then the generator MAY choose to generate code that implements the constraint or rule. For example, when mapping the LinkML metaslot maximum_value to Pydantic, a Field with property maximum_value should be used. This makes the generated code more declarative, and takes advantage of the target framework's builtin abilities to perform validation. If mapping to a target that does not support the feature then code generation may be applied. For example, if there is no equivalent direct correspondence to maximum_value , then the generated construct MAY include a validation procedure that checks the value against the maximum. Complex boolean ranges Mapping of enums Runtime dependencies A generator MAY choose to generate code that is either self-contained, or that has runtime dependencies. The runtime library SHOULD be kept minimal, within the constraints of the requirements of the runtime library. Mapping of types Types SHOULD be mapped to one of the following: primitive types in the target language type variables class-like structures that can emulate scalar-like properties Some languages like Java have a choice for primitives, either builtin like str or classes like String . Metaclasses If the target language supports it then metaclasses may be used to type generated LinkML classes.
