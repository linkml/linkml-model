Instances represent things of interest in a particular domain, such as individual people, biological samples, places, events, or abstract entities. </p> <p>Instances are either primitive types such as numbers or strings, or objects that are typed using classes from a LinkML schema. Classes are categories or groupings of things in the domain of interest; for example, <code>Person</code>, <code>Medical History</code>, <code>Data file</code>, or <code>Country</code>. Instances can be inter-related by assigning values to particular slots; for example, an instance of a Person may have values for slots <code>name</code> or <code>country of birth</code>.</p> <p>LinkML schemas also specify rules for determining if instances conform to the schema, and for inference adding additional implicit slot values.</p> <p>LinkML is independent of any programming language, database technology, and is independent of any concrete form for serializing instances of schemas. Mappings are provided for serializing instances as JSON, YAML, RDF, flat tables, or relational models, or for mapping to programming language structures. However, the structure and semantics of LinkML are not dependent on any of these.
