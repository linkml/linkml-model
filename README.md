## About LinkML

LinkML is a modeling framework for building datamodels and related applications.

The best place to start discovering more about linkml is on the main LinkML website, [linkml.io/linkml](https://linkml.io/linkml)

LinkML is self-describing, and the underlying datamodel for describing data models is in LinkML. This repository contains that data model
