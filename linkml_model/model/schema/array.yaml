  Array:
    description: >-
      A data structure where an N-dimensional array is represented as a class rather than an attribute. There
      must be exactly one attribute that is an array. There may be other attributes associated with the array
      but they must not be arrays themselves.

  DataArray:
    description: >-
      A data structure containing an Array and a set of Arrays that are used to label the elements of the Array.
      The set of Arrays are also known as coordinates.

  Dataset:
    description: >-
      A data structure containing one or more main Arrays with aligned dimensions and a set of Arrays that are used to
      label the elements of the Arrays. The set of Arrays are also known as coordinates. A Dataset with only one
      main Array is equivalent to a DataArray. If there are multiple main Arrays, then all dimensions must refer to
      points in the same shared coordinate system, i.e., if two Arrays have the same dimension "x", that dimension
      must be identical in both Arrays.
