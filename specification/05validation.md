# Validation using Schemas

**Validation** is a procedure that takes as input:

* A LinkML instance  `i`, where `i` is to be validated
* A LinkML instance `root`. This MUST contain `i` and MAY be the same as `i`
* A schema *m*

The validation procedure will produce output that can be used to determine if the instance is *structurally and semantically valid* according to the schema.

The formal specification of the validation procedure takes as input a *derived* schema *m<sup>D</sup>*:

```mermaid

    M[Asserted Schema] --> Derivation{Derivation Procedure}

    R[Rules] --> Derivation
    I[Instance] --> Validation{Validation Procedure}
    Validation -->|produces| Results[Validation Results]
    Mstar --> Validation
```

Actual implementations may choose to perform this composition or work directly on the asserted schema.

The following holds for any validation procedure:

- The output MUST include a boolean slot indicating whether the input can be demonstrated to be false
- The output SHOULD include additional information about the nature of all problems encountered. 
- The output SHOULD be conformant with the LinkML validation schema.
- The output MAY also return cases where *recommendations* are not adhered to
- The output MAY also be combined with parsing to yield the precise location (i.e. line numbers) in the source serialization document where problems are found.
- The procedure MAY restrict validation to defined subsets (profiles) of the Metamodel
- The procedure  SHOULD return in its payload an indication of which profile and version is used.

## Validation procedure for instances

The validation procedure is to first take the metaclass that is instantiated by the type of the instance `i`,
and apply one of the 4 checks below, with each check performing its own sub-rules. The ClassDefinition check
is *recursive*, checking each slot-value assignment. This means a check on any instance will always validate the
full instance tree.

## Validation of ClassDefinitions

Given an instance `i` of a ClassDefinition:

**ClassDefinitionName**( **Assignments** )

Where **Assignments** is a collection of length `N`, with index `i..N` and members `slot_i=value_i`,
and *ClassDefinitionName* is the name of a ClassDefinition in *m<sup>D</sup>*, such that `C`=m<sup>D</sup>`.classes[ClassDefinitionName]`

### Rule: Assignment values must be valid

for each `slot=value` assignment in **Assignments**, the validation procedure is performed on `value`, with
`root` remaining the same

### Rule: ClassDefinition instances must instantiate a class in the schema

*ClassDefinitionName* MUST be the name of a ClassDefinition in *m<sup>D</sup>*

`C` is assigned to be the value of m<sup>D</sup>`[ClassDefinitionName]`

**Assignments** is assigned to be the value of `C.attributes` (see the previous section)

`C` SHOULD have all the following properties:

- `C.deprecated` SHOULD be `None`
- `C.abstract` SHOULD NOT be `True`
- `C.mixin` SHOULD NOT be `True`

### Rule: identifiers must be unique

We define a procedure **IdVal**(`i`) which yields the value of `i.<identifier_slot>` where `identifier_slot`
is the slot in **Assignments** with metaslot assignment `identifier=True`

If there is no such slot then **IdVal**(`i`) is `None` and this check is ignored.

`i` is invalid if there exists another instance `j` such that `j` is reachable from `root`,
and **IdVal**(`i`)=**IdVal**(`j`) and `i` and `j` are distinct.

### Rule: All assignments must be to permitted slots

For each `s=value` assignment in <*Assignment1*>, <*Assignment2*>, ..., <*AssignmentN*>:

- `s` must be in **Assignments**

### Rule: All required slots must be specified

For each slot `s` in **Assignments**, if `s.required=True`, then `i.<s>` must be neither `None` nor the empty collection `[]`

### Rule: All recommended slots should be specified

For each slot `s` in **Assignments**, if `s.recommended=True`, then `i.<s>` should be neither `None` nor the empty collection `[]`

If this condition is not met, this is considered a warning rather than invalidity

### Rule: Assigned values must conform to multivalued cardinality

For each slot `s` in **Assignments**,

 * if `s.multivalued` is `True`, then `i.<s>` must be a collection or `None`
 * If `s.multivalued` is `False`, then `i.<s>` must not be a collection

### Rule: values should be within stated bounds

For each slot `s` in **Assignments**,

 * if `s.maximum_value` is not `None`, then `i.<s>` must be a number and must be less that or equal to the maximum value
 * if `s.minimum_value` is not `None`, then `i.<s>` must be a number and must be greater that or equal to the minimum value

### Rule: values should equal evaluable expression

For each slot `s` in **Assignments**, if `s.equals_expression` is not `None`, then `i.<s>` must equal
the value of `Eval(s.equals_expression)`. See section on expression language
for details of syntax.

Note: this rule can be executed in inference mode

### Rule: values should equal string_serialization

For each slot `s` in **Assignments**, if `s.string_serialization` is not `None`, then `i.<s>` must equal
the value of `Stringify(s.string_serialization)`. See section on expression language
for details of syntax.

### Rule: values should equal regular expression patterns

Note: this rule can be executed in inference mode

### Range class instantiation check

For each slot `s` in **Assignments**, if `i.<s>` is not `None`, and `s.range` is in `m*.classes`,
then `s.range` must be in `ReflexiveAncestors(Type(i.<s>))`

 Additional checks MAY be performed based on whether `s.inlined` is `True`

 * if `s.inlined` is `True`, then `i.<s>`  SHOULD NOT be a Reference
 * if `s.inlined` is `False`, then EITHER:
     * `i.<s>`  SHOULD be a Reference
     * OR `i.<s>` instantiates a class `R` such that `R` has no slot `rs` that is declared to be an identifier. i.e. `rs.identifier = True`



### Boolean combinations of expressions

There are 4 boolean operator metaslots:

- any_of
- exactly_one_of
- none_of
- all_of

These can apply to classes, slots, types, or enums. The range is always a list of operand expressions
of the same type.

In all cases, the semantics are as follows:

- any_of: true if there exists a member of the operands that evaluates to true
  * for empty lists this is always false
- exactly_one_of: true if there exists a member of the operands that evaluates to true, and all other members evaluate to false
  * for empty lists this is always false
- none_of: true if there does not exist a member of the operands that evaluates to true
  * for empty lists this is always true
  * for lists of length 1 this is the same as the logical NOT operator
  * for lists of length 2 this is the same as the logical XOR operator
- all_of: true if there are no members that evaluate to false
  * for empty lists this is always true
   
### range expression checks

For each slot `s` in **Assignments**, if `i.<s>` is not `None`, and `RE = s.range_expression` is not `None`, then a check
**CE**(`x`) is performed on `i.<s>`

### Rule evaluation

For each rule `r` in *C*.rules:

- if `r.preconditions` is `None` or `r.preconditions` is satisfied, then
- `r.postconditions` are applied

### Classification Rule evaluation

### type designator checks

## Validation of TypeDefinitions

For each slot `s` in **Assignments**, if `i.<s>` is not `None`, and `s.range` is in `m*.types`,
where `i.<s> = *T*( **AtomicValue** )` must match `s.range`,

here `T.uri` is used to determine the type:

- for xsd floats, doubles, and decimals, AtomicValue must be a decimal- for xsd floats, doubles, and decimals, AtomicValue must be a decimal
- for xsd ints, AtomicValue must be an Integer
- for xsd dates, datetimes, and times, AtomicValue must be a string conforming to the relevant ISO type
- for xsd booleans, AtomicValue must be `True` or `False`

## Validation of EnumDefinitions

For each slot `s` in **Assignments**, if `i.<s>` is not `None`, and `s.range` is in `m*.enums`,
then `i.<s>` must be equal to `pv.text` for some pv in `m*.enums[s.range]`
